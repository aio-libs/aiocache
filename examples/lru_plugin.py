    Implements a Least Recently Used policy with max_keys. The policy does the following:
        - When a key is retrieved get, keys are moved to the beginning of the queue
        - When a key is added (set), keys are added to the beginning of the queue. If
            the queue is full, it will remove as many keys as needed to make space for the new
            ones.
    IMPORTANT!
        - The queue is implemented using a Python deque so it is NOT persistent!
        - Careful when working on distributed systems, you may run into incosistencies if this
            policy is run from different instances that point to the same endpoint and namespace.
        - To have a full LRU, you should also implement the add, multi_set and multi_get methods.
